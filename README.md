## Project Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Development

To run the development server:

```

This will typically start the server on `http://localhost:5173`.
